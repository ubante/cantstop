# cant stop
I found this simple game at https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=cantstop and 
the rules are at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can%27t_Stop_(board_game)#Rules

There were a couple of questions I had about decision making.  This repo will 
simulate the game to answer these questions.

So far, I've learned to choose 7.  For more critical analysis, check out
